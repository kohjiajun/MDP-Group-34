# Android Bluetooth Connection Testing

This directory contains test scripts to verify the Bluetooth connection between the Raspberry Pi and Android tablet.

## Test Scripts

### 1. `simple_connection_test.py` (Recommended for first-time testing)
- Basic connection test
- Simple message sending/receiving
- Good for initial setup verification

### 2. `test_android_connection.py` (Comprehensive testing)
- Full connection testing
- Multiple message types
- Connection stability testing
- More detailed error reporting

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure:

1. **Bluetooth is enabled on Raspberry Pi:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status bluetooth
   ```

2. **Bluetooth packages are installed:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3-bluetooth bluetooth libbluetooth-dev
   pip3 install PyBluez
   ```

3. **Android tablet is ready:**
   - Bluetooth is enabled
   - Device is discoverable
   - No other active Bluetooth connections

## Running the Tests

### Simple Connection Test
```bash
cd RPi/communication
python3 simple_connection_test.py
```

### Comprehensive Test
```bash
cd RPi/communication
python3 test_android_connection.py
```

## Expected Output

### Successful Connection
```
=== Simple Android Bluetooth Connection Test ===

1. Attempting to establish Bluetooth connection...
   Make sure your Android tablet is ready to connect...
   The RPi will be discoverable for Bluetooth pairing.
   âœ“ Connection established successfully!

2. Sending test message...
   âœ“ Sent: {"cat": "info", "value": "Hello from Raspberry Pi!"}

3. Waiting for response (5 seconds)...
   âœ“ Received: {"cat": "response", "value": "Hello from Android!"}

4. Sending final message...
   âœ“ Sent: {"cat": "status", "value": "test_complete"}

   âœ“ Basic connection test completed!

5. Cleaning up connection...
   âœ“ Connection closed successfully!

=== Test completed! ===

ðŸŽ‰ Connection test successful!
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied Errors:**
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x simple_connection_test.py
   sudo python3 simple_connection_test.py
   ```

2. **Bluetooth Service Not Running:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start bluetooth
   sudo systemctl enable bluetooth
   ```

3. **Port Already in Use:**
   ```bash
   sudo hciconfig hci0 down
   sudo hciconfig hci0 up
   ```

4. **Connection Timeout:**
   - Ensure Android tablet is in pairing mode
   - Check if other devices are connected
   - Restart Bluetooth on both devices

5. **Import Errors:**
   - Verify the `communication` module is in the correct path
   - Check Python path configuration

### Debug Commands

Check Bluetooth status:
```bash
sudo hciconfig -a
sudo bluetoothctl
```

Check for active connections:
```bash
sudo lsof -i :1
```

Reset Bluetooth:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
sudo hciconfig hci0 reset
```

## Test Scenarios

### Basic Connectivity
- Connection establishment
- Simple message exchange
- Proper disconnection

### Message Types
- Info messages
- Status updates
- Location data
- Image recognition results
- Control commands

### Connection Stability
- Continuous message sending
- Long-running connections
- Error handling and recovery

## Notes

- The RPi will be discoverable during testing
- Each test run creates a new Bluetooth service
- The service UUID is: `94f39d29-7d6d-437d-973b-fba39e49d4ee`
- Test scripts automatically clean up connections
- Timeouts are set to prevent indefinite waiting

## Next Steps

After successful testing:
1. Integrate with your main robot control application
2. Implement proper error handling and reconnection logic
3. Add message validation and security measures
4. Consider implementing heartbeat/ping mechanisms for connection monitoring
